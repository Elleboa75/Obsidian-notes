# Resonance frequency
$f_0 = \frac{c}{2\pi}\sqrt{\frac{A}{VL}}$
	Some books use $f_1$ to denote fundamental frequency
*Vocal folds* have their fundamental / resonance frequency. It is the lowest frequency in a sound. Fundamental frequency is denoted as $f_0$
	- It is not the same as 
	- Where A = Area of the opening
	- V = volume of the resonator
	- L = length of the opening
	- c = speed of sound in the medium.
