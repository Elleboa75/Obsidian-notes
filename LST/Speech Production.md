# Speech Production
Three systems are involved in speech production:

## Models of speech production
- Levelt's WEAVER++ model (1999):
- Interactive two-step model (Dell et at, 1997;2007)

## Essentials of Linguistics 2.1-2.5

**articulatory phonetics** – “how we humans use our bodies to produce speech sounds.”

**acoustic phonetics** – “in addition to being part of linguistics, is also a branch of physics.  It’s concerned with the physical, acoustic properties of the sound waves that we produce.”

Three mechanisms used for speech production are:
- **respiration** at the lungs,
- **phonation** at the larynx,
- **articulation** in the mouth.

## The Handbook of Speech production - Chapter 3

*Mucosal wave* is a wave-like motion of the vocal fold surface

## Supra-glottal system – Articulation phase
	- This phase happens after air passes through vocal folds. 
- There are two **Helmholz resonators** (*nasal cavity* and *oral cavity*)
	- Frequency is determined by the following equation, where A is the diameter of cross-section area, L is the length of the resonator, and V is the volume of the cavity $$f=\frac{c}{2\pi}\sqrt{\frac{A}{VL}}$$ ![[Pasted image 20221028130027.png|200]]
- *Oral cavity* is divided by tongue creating *oral cavity* and *pharyngeal cavity*
- The area from the nose and the nasal cavity down to the vocal cords deep in the throat is called a **vocal tract**. It amplifies the frequencies

**Sonority** has to do with the amount of *acoustic energy* that a sound has. Loud sounds are more sonorous than quiet. Moreover, sounds that are made with lots of airflow from the lungs, and with vocal cords vibrating are sonorous.
- Vowels are sonorous
- Consonants are less sonorous
**Glides** are somewhere between vowels and consonants. The vocal tract is unobstructed for glides like for vowels, but they are shorter and less sonorous than vowels.

A *syllable* is a peak of sonority that is surrounded by less sonorous sounds. 
The most sonorous sound is called the **nucleus** of a syllable. 


***[[Resonance frequency]]*** $f_0 = \frac{c}{2\pi}\sqrt{\frac{A}{VL}}$
	Some books use $f_1$ to denote fundamental frequency
*Vocal folds* have their fundamental / resonance frequency. It is the lowest frequency in a sound. Fundamental frequency is denoted as $f_0$
	- It is not the same as 
	- Where A = Area of the opening
	- V = volume of the resonator
	- L = length of the opening
	- c = speed of sound in the medium.

***[[Harmonics]]*** – higher frequencies, multiples of $f_0$
	- 1st harmonic is $f_1 = 2*f_0$
	- Higher harmonics typically have smaller amplitude – strength 
	- On spectrograph harmonics are seen as thin vertical lines. The higher the density of harmonics, the lower is the fundamental frequency.

## Glottal system – phonation phase
- Vocal folds open and close in a vibrating fashion 
- *Bernoulli effect* – vibration of vocal folds caused during air flow / periodic train of air pulses
- *Whisper triangle* – vocal folds are mostly closed and leave a small triangle opened when whispering.
- Resonance of *vocal tract* determines vocal formants 

## Sub-glottal system – initiation phase
	Inspiration and expiration of air
	Mainly lungs really

*Trans-glottal pressure* difference causes a periodic train of air pulses

**[[Formants]]** are differences in frequency produced by our supra-glottal system. They show where the highest amplitude of frequency is.

### Vowels
Characterised by:

Vowels are *characterised by*:
- location of constriction, 
- tongue position, 
- mouth position

![[frequencyOfVowels.png|500]]

### Consonants
Characterised by:
	- place 
	- manner
	- voicing

### Speech characteristics:
**Periodicity**
Local maximum
Silence and [[prevoicing]] are associated with plosives.
Bursts
etc.
**[[Coarticulation]]** 
	- contextual sensitivity in production of language forms
	- temporally overlapping production
	Occurs in two directions:
	- **Anticipatory** – vowel u influences word onset in stew
	- **Carryover** – vowel u influences consonant in use

### Prosodic features
- *Prosody* – suprasegmental properties of speech
	- Properties of larger units of speech (syllables, words, utterances)
	- Reflects elements of language not encoded by grammar or choice of vocabulary
		- Contrast, prominence, irony, emotion 
- **Stress**: emphasis or accenting of words or syllables
	- Increased loudness
	- increased vowel length
	- full articulation of the vowel
	- changes in pitch
- **Intonation** – Controlled modulation of voice pitch across a phrase or phrases.
- **Tone** – pitch variation that affect the meaning of a word
	- Mandarin: contour 


**[[Fourier transform]]** – a pair of mathematical equations.
- *Fourier Analysis Equation* – frequency components.
- *Fourier Synthesis Equation* – time-domain signal.
- Fourier series – any signal can be approximated by sum of cosines (or sines)
