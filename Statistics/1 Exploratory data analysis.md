# 1 Exploratory data analysis
*Statistics:* Use measurements on gathered data from a sample to draw conclusions about a population parameter

- *Population* - Large set of interesting individuals 
	- E.g.: Cars built after 2015, people that own cats
- *Parameter* - A characteristic of interest in the population 
	- E.g.: Average mileage, height, happiness
- *Sample* - Representative measurable subset of population 
	- E.g.: University students
- *Variable* - A measured characteristic of the sample  
	E.g.: Age, length, weight, gender, hours of exercise per day
- *Data* - The total set of all measurements on the sample  
- *Statistic* - A measurement on the sample that estimates a parameter
	E.g. Average mileage, height, reported happiness on a 5-point scale

Problems with statistics:
- Your sample needs to be representative of your population
	- Structural differences between the sample statistic and the population parameter (i.e. bias) can lead to faulty conclusions
- You need to carefully plan how you will make measurements
	- Ensure that there are no confounding variables that support alternative conclusions 
	- Beware the placebo effect
- You need to carefully weigh assumptions against conclusions
	- Assumptions reduce work, but make calculations more complex 
	- Incorrect assumptions cause incorrect conclusions
- You need to calculate carefully
