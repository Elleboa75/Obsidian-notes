	Plots of residuals have not random distribution
In statistics, heteroskedasticity (or heteroscedasticity) happens when theÂ standard deviations of a predicted variable, monitored over different values of an independent variable or as related to prior time periods, are non-constant. With heteroskedasticity, the tell-tale sign upon visual inspection of the residual errors is that they will tend to fan out over time, as depicted in the image below.
