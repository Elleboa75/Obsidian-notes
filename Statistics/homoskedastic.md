	Homoskedactic distribution is random

### Homoskedastic distribution
[[correlation and linear regression#Anova|Anova]] is quite robust to non-normality of errors
- heavy skew (exponential distribution) does not affect ANOVA
- Heavy tails (uniform, beta) are an issue for small sample sizes (n<20 per group)
