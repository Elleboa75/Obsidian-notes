## Confidence intervals for proportions

## Prop test
We can use prop test to find the confidence interval for counts `x`, sample sizes `n` and the value of confidence level.
```R
prop.test(x, n, conf.level=0.95)
```
Ex.
	In a span of two weeks, the same poll is taken. The first time, 1,000 people are interviewed, and 560 agree; the second time, 1,200 are interviewed, and 570 agree. Find a 95% confidence interval for the difference of proportions.
```R
prop.test(x=c(560,570), n=c(1000,1200), conf.level=0.95)
```

## T-test with confidence interval
	T-test can be used to compute the confidence interval for the difference of means
```R
t.test(x, y, var.equal=FALSE, conf.level=0.95)
```
Ex.
	For the following data we  can assume equal variance looking at the boxplots generated ![[Pasted image 20221023110743.png | 400]]
```R
	x <- c(0, 0, 0, 2, 4, 5, 13, 14, 14, 14, 15, 17, 17)
	y <- c(0, 6, 7, 8, 11, 13, 16, 16, 16, 17, 18)
	boxplot(list(placebo=x, ephedra=y), col="gray")
```
Therefore, we can check confidence interval assuming equal variance
```R
confint(t.test(x,y, var.equal=TRUE))
## (-8.28, 2.70) with 95 percent confidence
```
