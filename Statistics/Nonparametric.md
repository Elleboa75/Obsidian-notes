	Data in which dhe distribution is unknown or cannot be easily identified
	
Data that *does not fit a known or well-understood distribution* is referred to as nonparametric data.

Data could be non-parametric for many reasons, such as:
-   Data is *not real-valued*, but instead is ordinal, intervals, or some other form.
-   Data is real-valued but *does not fit a well understood shape*.
-   Data is almost parametric but *contains outliers*, multiple peaks, a shift, or some other feature.
