## Introduction to Signals - Chapter 3
**periodic** signals - signals that continually trace the same path  
**aperiodic** - one that is not periodic

$f = \frac{1}{p}$ $f$ is a frequency and $p$ is period

Vocal cords produce a **sawtooth waveform**

There are also square and rectangular (also caller pulse trains) waveforms

*Aperiodic* signals can be split into:
- *random signals*
- *transient signals* - lasting only for a short time:
- *burst* like 't' in 'tap' occurs only for a moment
