# Sound perception
*Read **working of the ear** in reading materials*

## 1. outer ear (auricle and ear canal)
	Funnel acoustic waves into the ear canal
- **Auricle (pinna)**
	- Important for directional hearing
	- Discerns horizontally and vertically incoming signals
- **Ear canal**
	- It is Â±2.5 cm long
	- It can produce harmonics (resonance frequency) for certain frequencies depending on the length of the ear canal. 
	- There are only odd harmonics, as the canal is closed at one end
	- Filters sound that comes through.

Sound localisation:
- measuring a phase shift, we can determine the direction of source of sound
	- Works for short or low frequency sounds
- There is also a difference in amplitude 
	- Works best for high frequencies 

## 2. Middle ear
- Hammer, anvil and stirrup part
- It is filled with fluid, so the frequency changes 
- Tympanic membrane (eardrum) vibrated with air
- Hammer, anvil and stirrup transfer vibrations
- **Stapedius** is a tiny muscle between the stapes and the wall of the middle ear cavity. When contracted it dampens the vibrations transmitted to inner ear.
	- It can partially dampen loud sounds. Doesn't work for sudden sounds (explosions)

## 3. Inner ear
Also known as **cochlea**
- The part that actually translates vibrations into signals
- Basilar membrane (BM) contains receptors. It is considered a filter bank with bandpass filters. 


We can translate spectrogram into cochleogram to show how the sound is perceived by our ears.
