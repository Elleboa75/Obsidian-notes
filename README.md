The repository contains markdown files with notes for some subjects of Artificial Intelligence programme at RUG. 
# Description 
The notes present are based mostly on lectures and slides. Sometimes they give an additional explanation, but there are also aspects which may be skipped. The notes contained in the repository are neither perfect nor complete. They are shared here with a hope that they can be improved by future collaborators.

# Getting Started
## Online browsing
Because the notes are saved as markdown files, they can be viewed in GitHub. However, it is recommended to interact with the notes. Modify them, highlight what you find interesting and create new notes and connections. 
## Obsidian
The notes were originally created in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md), and it is the recommended software for working with the repository. 
### Style and plug-ins
The notes do not use any necessary plug-ins. However, they were created with [Minimal theme](https://minimal.guide/Home) with **bold** and *italics* text being coloured to make them stand out more. These colours may be essential for full appreciation of the notes that use them to highlight important parts and definitions. If you want to actually highlight text, there are multiple ways of doing that with a simple highlight using ==double spaces==, or <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Highlights Plug-in</mark> being two of them. 
## Modifying the repository
You can fork the project and download it inside your Obsidian Vault. There you can view and edit the files. If you feel like you've improved the notes, feel free to create a pull request and become a Contributor to the project.

The repository and the original notes were created by Wojtek Trejter. Finding a way to contact me is left as an exercise to the readers which should not be too challenging for students of RUG or Cover members.
