Qualities of a **Good story** by *Bennett & Feldman*
- Has a *central action*
- Has *no loose ends*
- *Unambiguously* explains the central action
- Contains *no contradictions*

*Pennington & Hastie*
A good story does not guarantee a unique outcome

**Story anchoring**
- Evidence is accepted or rejected as proof on the basis of anchors, i.e., common-sense generally true rules
---
- **Evidential rules** - Connect the evidence to elements of a story
- **Causal rule** - Connects elements in a story
---
- **Local coherence** is determined by the *causal ruler* connecting its events
- **Global coherence** is determined by the *story schemes* it matches

**"The DNA effect"**
	There is an idea gaining a momentum that Evidence is only valuable when it comes with scientifically supported statistics

Three normative frameworks:
- Arguments
- Scenario
- Probabilities
