## Argumentation
- positions
- proc and cons
- dialogue
- Conflict resolution

A bike of Mary is stolen and John buys the bike from the theft. Who’s bike is it?
	It depends on whether John knew it was stolen.

Use of argumentation:
- For internal reasoning:
	- Reasoning about beliefs, goals, intentions, actions
- For their interactions with other agents

## History of argumentation in AI

Reiter's logic for default reasoning (1980)
	- penguin example

Pollock's defeasible reasoning:
	- red light example – undercutting defeat. 
	- If an object looks red, is it red or is it illuminated by a red light

Toulmin\s *The uses of argument*:
	- Uses argumentation in reasoning

Phan Minh Dung's abstract argumentation (1995):
	- Dung proposed to focus on the argument attack relation as a mathematical directed graph
## Dung's abstract argumentation
Dung's basic principle of argument acceptability. 
An argument $\alpha$ is acceptable with respect to a set of argument A if for each argument $\beta$ ...
## Admissible sets
	A set of arguments A is admissible if:
	- They are conflict free
	- Each argument in A is acceptable with respect to A.

## preferred extensions, stable extensions
admissible set of arguments is a *preferred extension* if:
	- It is an admissible set that is maximal with respect to set inclusion

*Stable extension*:
- All arguments that are not in ==fill in this part==

**Basic properties**:
- A stable extension is a preferred extension, but not always the other way around
- sth
- sth
- sth

## computing the grounded extension

## Complete extensions
- They are conflict free
- Each argument in A is acceptable with respect to A.
- If $\alpha$ is acceptable with respect to A, $\alpha$ is in A.

We label arguments as *in*, *our*, *undec* 
A labelling is complete if the following properties hold:
- An argument $\alpha$ has a label *in* iff 
- sth
## Argumentation schemes
Douglas Walton proposed to collect argumentation schemes. 
Inference rules in logic are extended to argumentation schemes
