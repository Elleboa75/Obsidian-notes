# Speech acts
- Speech act theory emphasises the **pragmatics** of language.
- The syntax and semantics of language do not determine pragmatics

### Aspects of speech art
- **Locution**: *the physical act* of saying something.
- **Illocution**: *the associated act of showing* an intention or goal (stating, questioning, commanding, promising, ...).
- **Perlocution**: *the resulting action or event* (the change of a belief, the answer, the action, the obligation, ...).

### Types of speech act (John Searle)
- **Representatives**:  aimed at informing, e.g., ‘I made tea’
- **Directives**: aimed at the hearer doing something, e.g., ‘Please make the tea’ 
- **Commissives**: aimed at a commitment of the speaker, e.g., ‘I promise to make tea’
- **Expressives**: aimed at expressing a mental state, e.g., ‘I like this tea!’
- **Declaratives**: aimed at a change of the world, e.g., "I declare you man and wife"

### Components of speech acts
A **performative** verb: request, inform, premise, ...
**Propositional content**: "The door is closed"

“Please close the door”
 ▪  performative = request
 ▪  propositional content = “the door is closed”

# Protocols
### FIPA

### The contract net protocol
**The Contract Net Protocol** (Smith 1980) is a formalised protocol for task sharing with five phases:
- **Recognition**: The initiator recognises its problem Announcement: The initiator announces its problem to participants  
- **Bidding**: Participants make a proposal (a bid)
- **Awarding**: The initiator chooses one or more proposals.
- **Expediting**: The awarded proposals are executed.
# Auctions
- An auction takes place between an agent known as the *auctioneer* and a collection of agents known as the *bidders*
- The goal of the auction is for the auctioneer to allocate the good to one of the bidders
- In most settings, the auctioneer desires to maximise the price; bidders desire to minimise price

**Auctions and resource allocation**
- Auctions are tools to efficiently allocate scarce resources to agents
- Efficient here means: allocating the resources to the agents that value them the most
- Sometimes: an auction can reveal information about bidders

Goods can have:
- private value
- public/common value
- correlated value

Bids may be:
- open cry
- sealed bid

Winner pays:
- first price
- second price

Bidding may be:
- one shot
- ascending 
- descending
**English Auctions**
- First place
- Open cry
- Ascending price
- Dominant strategy is to successively bid a small amount more than the current highest bid
- Susceptible to winner's curse and shills

**Dutch auctions**
- Open cry
- Descending price
- Susceptible to winner's 

**First-Price Sealed-Bid Auctions**
- there is a single round
- bidders submit a sealed bid for the good    
- good is allocated to agent that made highest bid
- winner pays price of highest bid
- there is an incentive to bid less than true valuation

**Vickrey Auctions**
The winner pays the price of the second winner. The auction is sealed bid, second - price, one shot. 

**Lies and collusion**
The various auctions protocols are susceptible to lying on the part of the auctioneer, and collusion among bidders, to varying degrees
# Dialogue
- Communication often takes the shape of a dialogue.
- Especially in argumentation theory, protocols for various types of argumentative dialogue have been proposed.
- Dialogue has also been used to study language development

***Dialogue types***:
- **Persuasion** - Conflict of opinion. The goal is the resolution of the conflict
- **Inquiry** - Need to have proof. No conflict, common and theoretical problem
- **Negotiation** - Conflict of interests. Resolution is not the goal, but settlement is
- **Information seeking** - Need information. No conflict to be solved
- **Deliberation** - Dilemma or practical choice. No conflict, common, practical problem
- **Eristic** - personal conflict.  (characterised by a debate or an argument):

### Speech acts in argumentation dialogue
- **Claim** $\phi$ (make an assertion)
- **Argue** $\phi$ so $\gamma$ (give a reason)
- **Challenge** why $\phi$? (ask a question)
- **Retract** $\phi$ (withdraw a claim)

### Language development
**Talking heads** (Luc Steels and his team)

**Guessing game**
1. S chooses a topic
2. S tries to find a meaning in a discrimination tree
3. S looks up a signal for this meaning
4. H 'points' at the object it thinks or guesses is meant by S (pointing is transmitted info of where camera looks)
5. S sends success or failure message, possibly with a hint by pointing
