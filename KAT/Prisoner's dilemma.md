# Prisoner's dilemma
Two prisoners are offered a plea bargain.
	- Defect on their partner in return for reduced jail time.
	- Without a confession, jail time will be low.
	- With both confessions, jail time will increase for both.
	- In repeated prisoner's dilemma, it is more efficient to cooperate.
