# Availability cascade

A situation in which a certain news / aspects becomes widely available because it caught attention. After being recognised, the news is replicated and so becomes more and more available. 

“An availability cascade is a self-sustaining chain of events, which may start from media reports of a relatively minor event and lead up to public panic and large-scale government action.” ~ [[Thinking, fast and slow]]

The cascade is shared and distributed by [[Availability enterpreneurs]]
