# Problem solving & Intelligence

## Problem Solving:
- General problem solving
- Problem space approach
	- One method for studying problem solving is to ask to think aloud while working on a problem
- [[Hill-climbing strategy]] - Move toward the general direction of the solution. 
	- People don’t like taking methods which wake them away from the goal.
- Means-end analysis:
	- Create sub-problems which are easier to solve. 

Sometimes we need *analogy* to understand new things and solve problems.
- It is sometimes hard to find analogies. We need to look at the deep structure instead of the superficial one. 
- How to induce analogy use?
	- Let people discover the structure
	- Show more examples
	- Let people NOT categorise the problem
	- Compare examples, so that people focuses on deep structure
	- Understand why a solution is a solution

Expert problem solving:
- Experts see the deep structure of a problem
- Experts use analogies more often, but only in their domain of expertise
- It allows them to focus more on the broad strategies
- Experts can choose between many solution strategies
- Experts solve many different types of problems
- They don’t work backwards but from the initial state
	- They often recognise the type of problem
	- Therefore they can choose the correct strategy
- With unfamiliar problems, they resort to backwards reasoning
- Expertise is highly domain-specific!

[[Functional Fixedness]]



## Intelligence
- There are different types of intelligences (like 8 or sth)
- Intelligence scores are highly debatable:
	- Test scores improve with instructions and practice. 
	- There is a narrow domain of expertise. 
		- Book smart vs street smart
	- Tests are culturally biased
	- IQ test was supposed to find students with problems in learning 
- Intelligence is ability to reason, plan, solve problems, think abstractly, complement complex ideas, learn quickly and learn from experience
- Test of intelligence have sub scales (they are not important):
	- WAIS subtests:
		-   General knowleddge
		-   Vocabulary
		-   Comprehension
		-   Etc.
- Reliability is rather high
- There is a high predictive validity
	- They can pretty well predict academic performance (about 25% of the variance explained)
	- In more complex professions the score is between 0.6 and 0.8
- *General* vs *Specialised* intelligence types

**General intelligence**:
- Linguistic ability
- Numerical ability
- Spatial ability
- Etc.
Each of the subsets are specialised abilities and relate to **specialised intelligence** 

**Fluid intelligence**:
- Ability to deal with new and unusual problems
- Drops with age :(

**Crystallised intelligence**:
- Things acquired over years.
