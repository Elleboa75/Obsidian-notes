# Confirmation bias

People are:
- more responsive to evidence that *confirms* one’s beliefs
- Less responsive to evidence that *challenges* one’s beliefs
- People tend to inspect disconfirming evidence:
	- Looking for errors in reasoning
	- Re-interpretation of data until it fits with beliefs
	All this mental activity strengthens memory for disconfirming evidence. 
- There is a tendency to continue endorsing a belief 
	- Even when evidence has completely undermined it

Belief perseverance:
- A feedback In an experiment was provided randomly
- The participants were later informed about the randomness
- Later their beliefs about their abilities were still influenced by the random feedback. 

People choose a decision that they will not *regret* in the future. 
- They are not good at predicting what they would prefer in the future.
- They underestimate the chances that they will get used to something
- They assume their point of view will not change.
