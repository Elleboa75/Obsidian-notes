[[Cognitive Unconscious]]

[[Blind sight]] - People with damage to their [[Visual cortex]] can sometime unconsciously perceive their environment.

[[Subliminal perception]] - Unconscious perception which still can influence out decision making process.

[[Action slip]] - Sometimes we accidentally do what is routinely done instead of what we intended to do. Ex. We take a turn going to school when we want to get to a shop instead.
