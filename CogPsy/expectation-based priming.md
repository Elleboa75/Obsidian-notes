# expectation-based priming
It is expectation-driven and under our control. We deliberately prime detectors for inputs we expect to encounter. 
It takes resources and some time to change the attention later on.

For high validity expectation priming the cost of misleading information is as high as the benefit of correct priming. This is because incorrect data is unexpected for the brain.
