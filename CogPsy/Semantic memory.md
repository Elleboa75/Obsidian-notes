Concepts and categories

What are the basic elements of knowledge ?

What makes a penguin a penguin? It is not only a matter of definition.

What is it that makes a banana a banana?

Wittgenstein:
- Members of a category have a family resemblance to each other 

[[Prototype theory]]:
- Economical but less flexible
[[Exemplar Theory]]
- More flexible but less economical 
- We can ‘’tune’’ our concepts to match circumstances

- It seems we use **both** exemplars and prototypes 
- Both theories predict the same effects 
- Hypothesis: first we have exemplars, then we create prototypes 
- Experience involves *averaging exemplars to get prototypes*
- Diagnosis of dermatologists is better when they gave recently encountered a similar case - they use exemplars

 Some members are more *typical* for a category. 

 Categorisation is based not on resemblance, but on a deeper knowledge on **essential properties** 

**Flexible categories**: 
- **Ad hoc** categories  also show the *Prototype effect*
- We can rate typicality of the members of the ad hoc categories
