# Syntax
There are limitations on how to combine words.

*Phrase structure rules* and trees. These syntax rules are *descriptive*, not *prescriptive*. 
- Usually the highest costal standing group is defining the rules. 

*Garden-path sentences* - Sentences which are strange to read, yet syntactically correct.

N400 - The average of a number of EEG signals when the sentences are presented for the first time. 
N400 - A negative wave happening 400 ms after presentation.
