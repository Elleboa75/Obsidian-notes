# Long term memory

Names and concepts are remembered pretty similarly. 

Name matching is remembered more than picture cueing. It is easier to remember names of old classmates than it is for recognising the faces of them (?)

Our memories are better when we have [[Retrieval paths]] to that.It is easier to remember a joke in a certain environment.
