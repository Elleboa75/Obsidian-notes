# DRM procedure
Participants were given a list of words associated with sleeping, such as: “bed, rest, awake, tired, dream, snooze, wake etc”. Participants are extremely likely to recall ‘sleep’ as one of the words, although the word in not included in the list. Moreover, they are very confident in the occurrence of this word. 

It works both for recall and recognition.

It works also when people are warned that people tend to intrude words that are not on the list.
