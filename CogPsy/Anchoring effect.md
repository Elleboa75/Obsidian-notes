# Anchoring effect
Our decisions can be anchored to a given amount. If we first set an arbitrary value, our next decision can be influenced by the initial value remembered.

We ‘anchor’ our decision / estimation around the first value. 

Ex. Did Ghandi live to be 140 / 40 years? How old was Ghandi when he died?
- The results depend on the first question, which anchor the guess of the next question. 

Though anchoring we can influence the results of some guesses.
