# Cognitive Unconscious
The broad set of mental activities that you’re not aware of but that make possible your ordinary interactions with the world.

**Products** - beliefs you’ve formed, conclusions you’ve reached. 
**Processes** - What leads to creation of products. Unlike products, we are unaware of them.

**Unconscious reasoning** - Partially made out of the reasoning carried by [[System 1]] in [[Dual process model]]. 
	Nisbett & Schachter, 1966 - Participants were delivering electric shocks to them. One group got a placebo pill with side effects listed as the effects of fear. 
		- The control group used symptoms such as shaking hands and ‘upset’ stomach as [[somatic markers]]. The other group treated them as side effects of the pill.
		- Placebo group delivered the self 4x higher charge than the control group. 
		- Placebo group denied being influenced by the pill. They gave other reasons for their actions.
