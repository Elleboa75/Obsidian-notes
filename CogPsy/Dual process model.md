# Dual process model

**[[System 1]]** (fast): 
- Fast
- Automatic
- Uses heuristics

**[[System 2]]** (slow):
- Is slower
- Is effortful
- More likely to be correct

The system employed depends on:
- How much time is available for the decision?
- Are we under stress?
- How much attention and working memory are available?
- How the problem is presented - [[Framing]]
	- 10% or 10 out of a 100
- Are statistical concepts primed?
- Training can influence the likelihood of reasoning with system 2

How bad is it?
- Very bad.
- It’s enforces social stereotypes 
	- ‘She does not look like a computer scientist’ - [[Representativeness heuristics]]
