# Remembering complex events
Chapter 8
We remember things that di not happen

Errors arise because of **generalisation** and use of **schematic knowledge** 

Information is blurred and so forgetting can occur
- Unique events do not blur as easily 

Our memories are generally bad. Eye witnesses are not really too credible.
