# Retrieval paths
When we try to recall an event, we start from a given aspect of it. Ex. When thinking about a trip to a beach, start from the concept of a beach.

Activation of neurons spreads from that node, eventually reaching a node we seek. 

However, it is quite possible to make a transplant to that memory from another one of similar concept. Ex. Mixing two events into one.

Associating memories with an event can merge these memories together. Eventually is is impossible to separate the original memories and the transplants.

The connections between neurons, these retrieval paths make it harder to clearly establish boundaries between mamory episodes.
