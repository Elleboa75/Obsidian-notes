# Availability heuristics
One of the most important [[Heuristics]]. Instead of determining likelihood, frequency or possibility, we look for the **easiness of retrieval from memory**.

It can be incorrect as a result of:
- Bias in memory - Rare events are more memorable
- Stronger memory traces:
	- In lottery chances of winning are overestimated 
	- Doctors overestimate ethics chances of rare diseases 
- Bias in media 

Giving a few examples is easier than a lot of them.

The easiest it is to find examples / retrieve information from memory, the more probable it seems to happen.

Rare events are also well remembered. Ex. Terrorists attacks or plane crashes. 
Therefore we are likely to overestimate the probability of rare events happening.

One example of Availability heuristics is [[Ease of retrieval as information]]

Importance of availability heuristics:
	“Sunstein and a collaborator, the jurist Timur Kuran, invented a name for the mechanism through which biases flow into policy: the availability cascade. They comment that in the social context, “all heuristics are equal, but availability is more equal than the others.” They have in mind an expand Uned notion of the heuristic, in which availability provides a heuristic for judgments other than frequency. In particular, the importance of an idea is often judged by the fluency (and emotional charge) with which that idea comes to mind.“

- Induction often relies on attribute substitution— so that, for example, people estimate frequency by relying on availability. Thus, they judge an ob- servation to be frequent if they can easily think of many examples of that observation. The more avail- able an observation is, the greater the frequency is judged to be.
• Judgments based on the availability heuristic are often accurate, but they do risk error. The risk derives from the fact that many factors influence availability, including the pattern of what’s easily retrievable from memory and bias in what you notice in your experiences. ~ Cognition by Reisberg (book)
