# Schema
Pl. Schemata
Also **schematic knowledge**.

People spent 35 seconds in a room of a professor. After leaving the room, they were asked to recall the things present in the room. Many people recalled seeing books, as books are closely associated with academic offices. This is schematic knowledge. 

There are schemas we use in everyday life. We have some schema for procedure of eating at a restaurant. We expect to seat, be given a menu, order and have the menus taken etc. We do not have to remember having a menu to assume that we got one. We expect that from a restaurant.

Bartlett (1932):
- Native American stories were presented to British participants
- The gist of the story was recalled but the details were altered to match the Schemata they had.

Memories are **regularised** so that they match the expectations and schemata
Certain information is lost, other is added. 

Although schemas can introduce errors, they simplify our lives and make memories easier to compress and categorise.
It allows us time and attention to look for **specific** things, but also allows for **generalisation**. We can abstract away from the particulars.
